        <p class="intro-text">With chunks of sweet apples nestled in a tender and buttery rum cake, this 
            French apple cake is the essence of simplicity.</p>
        <h2 class="ingredients"><strong>Ingredients</strong>for 6-8 servings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>125 g all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>113 g unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>130 g granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling over cake</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>
            <li>2 baking apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1.5 cm cubes (I like Honeycrisp, 
                Fuji or Granny Smith) (3½ - 4 cups chopped)</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> Confectioners' sugar, for decorating cake</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="preparation"><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C and set an oven rack in the middle position. 
                Grease a 23-cm springform or regular cake pan with butter or nonstick 
                cooking spray. If using a regular cake pan, line the bottom of the pan 
                with parchment paper and grease again.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle 
                attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, 
                about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping 
                down the sides of the bowl after each addition.</li>
            <li>Beat in the vanilla and rum. Don't worry if the batter looks grainy at 
                this point; that's okay. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until 
                just combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped apples.</li>
            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even the top. Sprinkle evenly 
                with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. Bake for about 40 minutes, or 
                until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes 
                out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool on a rack in the pan. Once cool, run a blunt knife 
                around the edges of the cake. If using a springform pan, remove the sides. 
                If using a regular cake pan, carefully invert the cake onto the rack, 
                remove the parchment paper, then gently flip the cake over and place 
                right-side-up on a platter.</li>
            <li>Using a fine sieve, dust with confectioners' sugar (if using). 
                Cake can be served warm or room temperature, plain or with lightly 
                sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
            <li><em>Freezer Friendly Instructions:</em> The cake can be frozen for up to 
                3 months. After it is completely cooled, wrap it tightly with aluminum 
                foil or freezer wrap. Thaw overnight on the countertop before serving.</li>
        </ol>
