            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk (440ml)</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter (60g | 2 oz)</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, 
                baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the 
                centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
            <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before 
                slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until 
                smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).</li>
            <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with 
                a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan 
                and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your 
                ladle or measuring cup.</li>
            <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, 
                flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
